1. Create Data : We begin by creating our own data set for analysis. This prevents the end user reading this tutorial from having to download any files to replicate the results below. The data set will consist of 1,000 baby names and the number of births recorded for that year (1880). We will also add plenty of duplicates so you will see the same baby name more than once. You can think of the multiple entries per name simply being different hospitals around the country reporting the number of births per baby name. So if two hospitals reported the baby name "Bob", the data will have two values for the name Bob. We will start by creating the random set of baby names.

2. Prepare Data: The data we have consists of baby names and the number of births in the year 1880. We already know that we have 1,000 records and none of the records are missing (non-null values). We can verify the "Names" column still only has five unique names.We can use the unique property of the dataframe to find all the unique records of the "Names" column.

3. Analyze Data: We will simply find the most popular name in a specific year.

4. Present Data: Through tabular data and a graph, clearly show the end user what is the most popular name in a specific year.
