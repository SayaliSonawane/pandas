#Lesson 1

This tutorial is divided into 6 parts.

1. Importing libraries: The pandas library is used for all the data analysis excluding a small piece of the data presentation section. The matplotlib library will only be needed for the data presentation section. Importing the libraries is the first step we will take in the lesson.

2. Create Data: We begin by creating our own data set for analysis. This prevents the end user reading this tutorial from having to download any files to replicate the results below. We will export this data set to a text file so that you can get some experience pulling data from a text file. The data set will consist of 5 baby names and the number of births recorded for that year (1880).

3. Get Data: We will learn how to read in the text file. The data consist of baby names and the number of baby names born in the year 1880.

4. Prepare Data: Here we will simply take a look at the data and make sure it is clean. By clean I mean we will take a look inside the contents of the text file and look for any anomalities. These can include missing data, inconsistencies in the data, or any other data that seems out of place. If any are found we will then have to make decisions on what to do with these records.

5. Analyze Data: We will simply find the most popular name in a specific year.

6. Present Data: Through tabular data and a graph, clearly show the end user what is the most popular name in a specific year.
